### Lecture:  Tue/Thu 13:30–14:45, Sam Noble Museum Classroom
### Lab: Fri: 13:00–16:00, Sam Noble Museum Classroom
### Instructor:  Matthew J. Miller (mjmiller@ou.edu)
### TA:  Jessica McLaughlin (jfmclaughlin@ou.edu)

## COURSE DETAILS:
### Goals: 
The goal of this course is to develop a profound appreciation for birds. You will accomplish this by learning how to identify and observe wild birds in nature, by examining bird phenotypes in a lab/museum setting, and by studying the evolutionary of avian traits and the role that birds play in ecological processes. 

### Field work:  
Wild birds are outside; and in order to study birds we must go outside. There are several scheduled field trips during the semester, and you are required to go outside and observe birds on your own as well.  In general, Fall in Oklahoma is relatively mild, but you will need to be prepared for a variety of weather conditions during trips afield.  

Field trips during the lab period are mandatory. I have also scheduled one Saturday full day trip and one Friday – Sunday trip. While these trips are technically not mandatory, they are the best way to learn about birds from different habitats in our region, and they are going to be lots of fun. If you cannot attend one or more of these field trips, please tell me as soon as possible so that we can schedule make up work.

### Field guide: 
You will need to invest in a quality field guide to wild birds. This guide should cover all birds of North America; Oklahoma’s central location means that guides specific to either western or eastern USA will not suffice. A quality bird field guide should last any naturalist at least 10 years, probably more. I like the National Geographic Field Guide to the Birds of North America. It is relatively compact, but also has good illustrations and range maps.The Sibley Guide to Birds is perhaps superior, but it bulky for field carry. I have not used the Kauffman or Peterson guides.  Please do not get a “guide” to birds of Oklahoma. You want a book with greater geographic coverage. You will use your field guide on an almost daily basis during this semester.

### Binoculars: 
You will probably want to invest in a good pair of field binoculars. Anyone pursuing a career or graduate study in ecology, zoology, or wildlife will need a good pair of binoculars. And luckily, binocular technology has really improved over the last 10 years. You now can buy an excellent pair of binoculars for a few hundred dollars. Check out optics4birding.com for some recommendations. We will discuss binoculars during the first day of class. If you chose not to purchase your own binoculars, the Biology department has some that you can check out. Details to follow.

### Textbook:  
I have chosen the Handbook of Bird Biology, 3rd edition for this course. It is written as a textbook for bird enthusiasts. It has great examples from contemporary research, and awesome illustrations. Lecture material will be based largely on the material in this book.  I assign typically half of a chapter for each lecture.

Contemporary educational theory suggests that you will learn most by reading ahead of class. That way, our lecture time can be more interactive, as you are not seeing new concepts for the first and only time. However, I was a college student too, and I know that it was sometimes hard to find the time/motivation to read ahead of lecture. To encourage reading, most lectures will start with a brief reading quiz. This quiz is designed to encourage textbook reading accountability.

One final note; the textbook is heavy. Please don’t bring it to class. There is an ebook version of the text, though I haven’t used it.
